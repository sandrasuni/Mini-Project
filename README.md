# Mini-Project

The Mess Management System is a mini-project aimed at improving the way mess facilities are managed in educational institutions and hostels. Traditionally, managing a mess involves a lot of manual work, from tracking student attendance to managing inventory and processing leave requests. This project seeks to replace these manual processes with a digital system that is more efficient, accurate, and user-friendly.

The system is designed with several key modules that cater to both the administrative staff and the students. For the administration, the system allows easy management of student profiles, including adding, updating, and deleting records. It also includes a presence log feature to track the number of students present each day, which is essential for accurate billing and resource management. Students, on the other hand, can access their accounts, view their profiles, and see the current menu and their billing details.

Another important aspect of the Mess Management System is the Menu and Stock Management Module. This module helps the admin to manage the inventory efficiently by adding, updating, or removing stock items as needed. It also allows the admin to manage the daily and special menus, ensuring that students always have access to up-to-date meal options.

The system also includes a Leave Management Module, which simplifies the process of handling student leave requests. The admin can review and approve these requests, and the system automatically adjusts the billing based on the approved leaves. This ensures that students are only charged for the days they are present in the mess.

Finally, the Mess Billing Module automates the billing process, making it easier for both the admin and students to manage and review mess charges. The admin can add extra charges for special services, generate the monthly mess bill, and calculate the monthly profit and loss to assess the financial performance of the mess. Students can view their current and past bills, ensuring transparency in the billing process.

Overall, the Mess Management System aims to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of mess operations, making it easier for administrators to manage and for students to use.
